<p align="justify">Hi! I am Dr. Calvin Lu, the research program coordinator at the Complex Exposure Threats Center of Excellence (CETCE) for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I have strong scientific knowledge in cognitive neuroscience and physiology, data analytics, and program management. My current research focus is to understand factors that contribute to poor health outcomes and ongoing chronic symptoms of post-deployed Veterans. I am engaging in a multisystem and multi-data approach to examine the relationship between objective biophysiological markers, subjective ratings of health, health outcomes from electronic health records, and past military environmental exposure records to assess the health state of post-deployed Veterans.   
<br><br>
My research philosophy is.......

  ðŸ§  I recently finished:<br>
    1) Applying structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the complex relationship of mental health resilience in Veterans and mental health disorders such as PTSD or depression. The SEM successfully identified significant constructs attributing to an individual's resilience, and identified intervention strategies for Veterans to improve their mental resilience to reduce their mental health symptom burden. <br>
  2) Developed predictive machine learning model using a mixed effect approach to inform the likelihood of Veterans expressing suicide ideations. By leveraging simple surveys that are sent to Veterans on a quarterly frequency. The model utilizes features such as PTSD and neurological symptom severity, and quality of life can inform health care providers if the Veteran is at risk of suicide. <br> 
  3) Exploring the concept of mindfulness through electroencephalography (EEG). Using brain waves to understand the biophysiological features of proactive and reactive mindfulness.<br>
  <br>
  ðŸš€ Iâ€™m working on: <br>
  1) Preparing to launch the second phase of the <ins>V</ins>eterans <ins>M</ins>ilitary <ins>O</ins>ccupational and Environmental <ins>A</ins>ssessment <ins>T</ins>ool (VMOAT). The new iteration is focused on enhancing the UX and UI features of the instrument. <br>
  2) Exploring the use of natural language processing (NLP) for named entity recognition (NER) and text classification (TC) on ICD10 codes to identify commonality for particular military occupation, deployment location, or toxic exposure histories. <br>
  <br>
  ðŸ’­ I'm currently learning: <br>
  1) How to apply and develop neural network machine learning models for the Department of Veterans Affairs.<br>
  2) What new wearable technology has just released or is under development that I can leverage to improve telehealth capabilities and remote data research data collection.<br>
  <br>
  ðŸ˜Ž Fun fact: My wife and I are HUGE Disney fans and we have two Corgis.<br><br>
  â›³ In my free time I like to play golf, watch sports & movies, and go for a drive.<br>
